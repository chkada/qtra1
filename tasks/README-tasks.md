3. When all sub-tasks for a parent task are complete, mark the parent task as complete.
4. Follow the UI redesign rules in `ui-redesign-rules.md` when implementing UI-related tasks.

2. Confirm the brand hex values listed above
3. Verify available package scripts for linting, testing, etc.
4. Confirm acceptance of the specified libraries
5. Determine PR merge strategy (squash or merge commit)

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. Set up the development environment using Docker Compose
2. Start with the UI Implementation tasks if building the frontend from scratch
3. If focusing on redesign, start with the UI Redesign tasks
4. For backend enhancements, begin with the Backend Enhancement tasks
5. For infrastructure improvements, use the DevOps tasks

Follow the task lists in order, and mark tasks as complete as you progress then commit all the changes to the github repository
